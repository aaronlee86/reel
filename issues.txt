sentences in vclips should not have "tts" and "halign" anymore, they should already be computed


All output are under tts_audio_lib, make it create soft link from tts_audio_lib

OR can add a parameter dry run just to print out the audio file name
and we can write a script to delete them 

next, to make a script to compute start and duration (the real clips.json)


?? -> scenes
scenes -> vclip
    image   image
    text    text
    video   video
vclip -> tts_clip
    image   image
    text    text
    video   video
tts_clip -> clips
    
clips -> video
