You are solving a TOEIC Listening Part 4 question (1 talk + 3 follow-up question + 1 visual).

## Global Rules
- Comprehend the talk
- Understand the question
- Think logically for every option
- Give a score 0 to 100 to each option based off of correctness (0: completely wrong; 100: completely correct)

## Visual Rules
- During few-shot examples, visual information is provided in "visual_description".
- During real verification, "visual_description" is NOT provided, you must analyze the base64 image directly.
- The model must extract visual meaning from the base64 image.
- Never hallucinate objects that are not visible in the image.
- Use visual evidence only when relevant to a question.

## Few-Shot Example 1
Input:
{
  {"type": "input_image", "image_url": "data:...." // real verification will have base64 image here},
  {"visual_description": "a program schedule.
Layout and Content:
Overall Frame: The entire content must be enclosed within a thick, ornamental double-line border. This border should have geometric, interlocking corner embellishments resembling interwoven patterns.
Main Title: Centered at the top, inside the border, display the word "Program". This title should be in a larger, bold, italicized serif font.
Column Headers: Below the main title, left-aligned with two distinct columns, display the headers "Presenter" and "Time". These should be in a medium-sized, italicized serif font.
Schedule Items (Aligned under headers):
On separate lines below the headers, list the following, maintaining the two-column alignment:
Ms. Carbajal | 1:00–1:50
Mr. Buteux | 1:55–2:45
BREAK | 2:45–3:00
Mr. Chambers | 3:00–3:50
Ms. Ohta | 3:55–4:45
All text for schedule items should be in a standard-sized, non-bold, italicized serif font."} // This field is only in Few-Shot example. In real verification, there will be no such field.
  "talk": "We’re happy to see you all at this seminar this afternoon — we have a lot of useful information to cover. But before we start, a few administrative details. There will be one break, half way through
the afternoon. You can leave your laptops here if you leave the room—there will always be someone in here—but do keep your money and phones or … ah … other small electronic
devices with you. Don’t leave them at the tables. And please note that there’s an error in your printed program: there will be a change—a switch—in times for the last two presenters. Ms. Ohta
has to leave a little early today.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "Where most likely is the speaker?",
      "A": "At a hall",
      "B": "At a musical performance",
      "C": "At a retirement celebration",
      "D": "At a training seminar"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are listeners asked to do?",
      "A": "Carry cell phones with them",
      "B": "Carry their valuables with them",
      "C": "Leave money at the tables",
      "D": "Leave laptops in the room"
    },
    {
      "question": "Look at the graphic. Who will be the final presenter?",
      "A": "Ms. Carbajal",
      "B": "Mr. Buteux",
      "C": "Mr. Chambers",
      "D": "Ms. Ohta"
    }
  ]
}

Output:
{
  "answer": [ // give answer in order
    { // first element correspond to the first question
      "A": 40, // give 40 because it's too general
      "B": 0, // give 0 because it's obviously wrong
      "C": 0, // give 0 because it's obviously wrong
      "D": 100, // give 100 because demonstration is somewhat similar to presentation,
      "explain_A": "A hall is too general — many events take place in halls", // at most 2 sentences of explanation of A's score
      "explain_B": "This talk is administrative and informational—nothing about music, instruments, or a performance.", // at most 2 sentences of explanation of B's score
      "explain_C": "The talk does not reference any celebration", // at most 2 sentences of explanation of C's score
      "explain_D": "The speaker literally says “at this seminar this afternoon” and refers to useful information to cover and presenters." // at most 2 sentences of explanation of D's score
    },
    { // second question
      "A": 90, // give 90 because it's almost correct
      "B": 100, // give 100 because it's totally correct
      "C": 0, // give 0 because it's obviously wrong
      "D": 30, // give 30 because not logically correct
      "explain_A": "Listeners are told to keep their phones with them. However, the instruction is broader than just phones — it includes money and other small electronic devices.",
      "explain_B": "The speaker says to keep money, phones, and other small electronic devices with them. This matches 'carry their valuables' exactly.",
      "explain_C": "The speaker tells them NOT to leave money at the tables. This is the opposite of the instruction.",
      "explain_D": "The speaker says listeners MAY leave their laptops in the room. This is mostly correct, but it is not what listeners are specifically 'asked to do' — it's optional, not a requiremet."
    },
    { // third question
      "A": 0, // give 0 because it's obviously wrong
      "B": 0, // give 0 because it's obviously wrong
      "C": 100, // give 100 because it's totally correct
      "D": 0, // give 0 because it's obviously wrong
      "explain_A": "Ms. Carbajal is the first presenter at 1:00–1:50. The schedule change affects only the last two presenters, so she cannot be the final presenter.",
      "explain_B": "Mr. Buteux presents before the break (1:55–2:45). He is not involved in the switch and cannot become the final presenter.",
      "explain_C": "Ms. Ohta must leave early, so her late slot (3:55–4:45) is moved earlier. Therefore Mr. Chambers, originally before her, becomes the final presenter.",
      "explain_D": "Ms. Ohta cannot be the final presenter because the speaker says she has to leave early. She moves to an earlier time slot." // at most 2 sentences of explanation of D's score
