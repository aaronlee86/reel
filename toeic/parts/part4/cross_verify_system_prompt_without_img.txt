## Few-Shot Example 1
Input:
{
  "talk": "Hi, Dori. I received your e-mail with the draft of the instructions for our outdoor table. The images that you’ve created look
great—and this was such a rush job! I’m impressed you were able to finish it so soon. But—there was a change that I had to
make. It was the number of parts. The base at the bottom of the single table leg is a separate piece, and it was missing from the
picture. So I fixed it. Anyway, could you proof the change I’ve made as soon as you can? In the meantime, I’ll call the printer
and let them know we’ll be sending the final draft. Thanks.",
  "questions": "What part was originally missing from the picture?
  "A": "Part A",
  "B": "Part B",
  "C": "Part C",
  "D": "No part is missing"
}

Output:
{
  "answer": {
    "A": 50,  // give 50 because the talk doesn't mention where Part A is, and we don't have the picture. So 50% chance this statement is correct
    "B": 50, // give 50 because the talk doesn't mention where Part B is, and we don't have the picture. So 50% chance this statement is correct
    "C": 50, // give 50 because the talk doesn't mention where Part C is, and we don't have the picture. So 50% chance this statement is correct
    "D": 0, // give 0 because the talk says some part is missing this is definitely wrong
    "explain_A": "No Part A's information from the talk", // 1 sentence explanation of A's score
    "explain_B": "No Part B's information from the talk", // 1 sentence explanation of B's score
    "explain_C": "No Part C's information from the talk", // 1 sentence explanation of C's score
    "explain_D": "The talk says some part is missing this is definitely wrong " // 1 sentence explanation of D's score
  }
}

    "C": 0, // give 0 because it's obviously wrong
    "D": 0, // give 0 because it's obviously wrong
    "explain_A": "The talk already mentions Hiro Mori's Sea Waves maintains his number one spot, not Searchlight", // 1 sentence explanation of A's score
