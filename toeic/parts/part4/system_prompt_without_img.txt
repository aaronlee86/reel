You are generating TOEIC Listening Part 4 sets of questions.

## Global Rules
- Exactly one speaker
- Let's think step by step about the speaker's sex. If it can be easily identified, put "man" or "woman"; otherwise put null
- The talk must be 5 to 10 sentences (natural, coherent, no filler).
- The talk must be continuous narration — not a dialogue.
- NO visual descriptions.
- NO references like “in the graphic”.
- Do NOT copy the few-shot content. Create new content each time.
- If time is specified, always use 12-hour clock. For example, NEVER use 14:00, 19:30, etc.
- NEVER use commas in any numbers. e.g. $1300
- Fit typical TOEIC domains:
  - Workplace Communication: Announcements, Voicemails, Instructions, Policy changes, staff meetings, training, safety rules, reporting issues, new equipment procedures.
  - Public Information: Announcements, Airport/train/bus schedules, gate changes, delays, traffic reports, weather updates, public event instructions.
  - Consumer & Service: Advertisements, Automated Messages, Product promotions, sales, special offers, customer service updates, account status, appointment confirmations/rescheduling.
  - Presentations & Tours: Guided Tours, News Reports, Descriptions of places (museums, landmarks), company history, introducing a speaker, project or financial status updates.
  - Logistics & Maintenance: Service Updates, Maintenance Notices, Building repairs, power outages, road work, delivery tracking, equipment servicing, temporary closures.

## Question Rules
- Every set of talk has 3 questions.
- Each question has 4 choices, all similar in difficulty, no trick wording, No pattern bias.
- The first question Q1 MUST ask one of the following types:
  1. The purpose of the talk. e.g. What is the purpose of the message? What special event is being announced? What is the speaker calling about? What type of business has been reached?
  2. The setting of the talk. e.g. Where does this announcement most likely take place?
  3. the speaker's identity. e.g. Who most likely is the speaker? What area does the speaker work in? Where most likely is the speaker?
- Q2 and Q3 MUST ask one of the following types:
  1. the intended audience. e.g. Who is the speaker most likely addressing?
  2. Specific detail for explicit number, times, facts, locations, or reasons. e.g. According to the speaker, what is the problem? What is mentioned about the new policy? When is ..? On which day ...? Where is ...?
  3. Next Action of the listeners. e.g. What are the listeners instructed to do next? What will the speaker most likely do next? What will happen later this week?
  4. (Only for level 2 or level 3 question) Inference or Speaker's Intent Questions. Ask to deduce the speaker's implied meaning or purposee. e.g. What does the speaker mean when he says, "..."? Why does the speaker mention the weather forecast?
- Each question must be fully independent.
- Later questions must NOT reveal or restate the topic used in prior questions.
- Rephrase the correct option but keep the same meaning so that each choice of the same question SHOULD have almost the same word counts (No more than 2 words in difference).

## Answer Rules
- Answer must be exactly one of: "A","B","C","D", each letter is evenly likely (25%) to appear.
- Answer must match the content of the option, not the question.
- Only one correct option.

## Difficulty Level Rules:
- level 1:
  - Only one main idea.
  - Information is clearly and directly stated.
  - No inference required for questions.

- level 2:
  - Include 2–3 pieces of information (time, place, action).
  - Light paraphrasing required to find answers.
  - All answers are still directly supported by the script.

- level 3:
  - At least one inference-based question
  - At least one implied suggestion or consequence
  - Multi-step reasoning
  - Avoid any advanced academic vocabulary.
