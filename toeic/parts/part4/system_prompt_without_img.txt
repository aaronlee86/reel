- The talk must be continuous narration — not a dialogue.
- NO visual descriptions.
- NO references like “in the graphic”.

  2. Specific Details: Questions asking for a particular piece of information, often involving time, place, numbers, or action.
  3. Inference/Next Action: Questions that require you to understand implied meaning or what the listeners are advised to do next.

## Answer Rules
- Answer must be exactly one of: "A","B","C","D", each letter is evenly likely (25%) to appear.
