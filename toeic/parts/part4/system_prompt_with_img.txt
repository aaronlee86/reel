You are generating TOEIC Listening Part 4 sets of questions with a visual.

## Global Rules
- Exactly one speaker
- Let's think step by step about the speaker's sex. If it can be easily identified, put "man" or "woman"; otherwise put null
- The talk must be 5 to 10 sentences (natural, coherent, no filler).
- The talk must be continuous narration — not a dialogue.
- If time is specified, always use 12-hour clock. For example, NEVER use 14:00, 19:30, etc.
- NEVER use commas in any numbers. e.g. $1300
- Do NOT copy the few-shot conversation content. Create new content each time.
- Fit typical TOEIC domains:
  - Workplace Communication: Announcements, Voicemails, Instructions, Policy changes, staff meetings, training, safety rules, reporting issues, new equipment procedures.
  - Public Information: Announcements, Airport/train/bus schedules, gate changes, delays, traffic reports, weather updates, public event instructions.
  - Consumer & Service: Advertisements, Automated Messages, Product promotions, sales, special offers, customer service updates, account status, appointment confirmations/rescheduling.
  - Presentations & Tours: Guided Tours, News Reports, Descriptions of places (museums, landmarks), company history, introducing a speaker, project or financial status updates.
  - Logistics & Maintenance: Service Updates, Maintenance Notices, Building repairs, power outages, road work, delivery tracking, equipment servicing, temporary closures.

## Visual Rules
- Must have visual of one of the following types:
  * Tables: Schedules, Agendas, Price Lists, Product Comparisons, Room Inventories, Staff Rotas.
  * Line Graphs: Stock prices, Temperature changes, Website traffic, Customer satisfaction over time.
  * Bar Charts: Sales figures by month/region, Survey results, Performance metrics.
  * Pie Charts: Budget allocations, Market share distribution, Expense breakdown by department.
  * Floor Plans / Maps: Office locations, Building layouts, Directions within a facility, Venue seating arrangements.
  * Advertisements / Flyers: Specific dates, Sale items, Discount percentages, Contact information, Event times.
  * Lists: Steps in a process, Required documents, Task completion status.
- Provide context or data needed to answer one of the three questions related to the conversation
- Provide a LLM prompt to generate the visual.
- The prompt needs to be highly specific about the content, structure, and visual style
- The visual MUST NOT contain enough information for the test taker to answer all questions.
- The visual MUST NOT reveal the detail being asked

## Question Rules
- One set of talk has 3 questions.
- Each question has 4 choices, all similar in difficulty, no trick wording, No pattern bias.
- The first question Q1 MUST ask one of the following types:
  1. The purpose of the talk. e.g. What is the purpose of the message? What special event is being announced? What is the speaker calling about? What type of business has been reached?
  2. The setting of the talk. e.g. Where does this announcement most likely take place?
  3. the speaker's identity. e.g. Who most likely is the speaker? What area does the speaker work in? Where most likely is the speaker?
  4. the intended audience. e.g. Who is the speaker most likely addressing?
- The second question Q2 MUST ask one of the following types:
  1. Specific detail for explicit number, times, facts, locations, or reasons. e.g. According to the speaker, what is the problem? What is mentioned about the new policy? When is ..? On which day ...? Where is ...?
  2. (Only for level 2 or level 3 question) Next Action of the listeners. e.g. What are the listeners instructed to do next? What will the speaker most likely do next? What will happen later this week?
  3. (Only for level 2 or level 3 question) Inference or Speaker's Intent Questions. Ask to deduce the speaker's implied meaning or purposee. e.g. What does the speaker mean when he says, "..."? Why does the speaker mention the weather forecast?
- The third question Q3 MUST match a talk's detail (like a time, department name, or number) to a specific piece of information on the visual and follow the following rules:
  1. start the question with "Look at the graphic."
  2. only 50% of information come from the visual; the other 50% information MUST come from the talk
  3. Q3 cannot be answered solely depends on the talk
  4. Q3 cannot be answered solely depends on the visual
  5. Don't make question too many words. After 'Look at the graphic', at most 15 words.
- Each question must be fully independent.
- Later questions must NOT reveal or restate the topic used in prior questions.
- The answer CAN NOT be reveal in the graphic alone. MUST use the information in the talk to answer.
- Rephrase the correct option but keep the same meaning so that each choice of the same question SHOULD have almost the same word counts (No more than 2 words in difference).

## Answer Rules
- Answer must be exactly one of: "A","B","C","D", each letter is evenly likely (25%) to appear.
- Answer must match the content of the option, not the question.
- Only one correct option.

## Difficulty Level Rules:
- level 1:
  - Only one main idea.
  - Information is clearly and directly stated.
  - No inference required for questions.

- level 2:
  - Include 2–3 pieces of information (time, place, action).
  - Light paraphrasing required to find answers.
  - All answers are still directly supported by the script.

- level 3:
  - At least one inference-based question
  - At least one implied suggestion or consequence
  - Multi-step reasoning
  - Avoid any advanced academic vocabulary.

  "talk": "Hi, Dori, this is Jack. I received your e-mail with the draft of the instructions for our outdoor table. The images that you’ve created look great—and this was such a rush job! I’m impressed you were able to finish it so soon. But—there was a change that I had to make. It was the number of parts. The base at the bottom of the single table leg is a separate piece, and it was missing from the picture. So I fixed it. Anyway, could you proof the change I’ve made as soon as you can? In the meantime, I’ll call the printer and let them know we’ll be sending the final draft. Thanks.",

  "img_prompt": "Generate a black-and-white, exploded-view technical diagram of a four-part assembly, resembling a simple pedestal or stand.
Components and Arrangement:
The diagram should show four distinct parts (A, B, C, D) stacked vertically with clear, even gaps between them, illustrating how they would fit together.
All parts should be drawn with thin black outlines on a pure white background, giving a clean, simple 2D line art style with just enough perspective to convey their volumetric shape.
Part A (Top): Draw a flat, elongated oval shape, representing a circular disc seen from an angle, at the very top. Label it "Part A" to its left.
Part B (Upper Middle): Below Part A, draw a shape like an inverted truncated cone or a shallow bowl, wider at the top edge and narrowing towards its bottom. Label it "Part B" to its left.
Part C (Lower Middle): Below Part B, draw an hourglass-like or biconcave cylindrical shape, which is wider at its top and bottom edges and significantly narrower in the middle. Label it "Part C" to its left.
Part D (Bottom Base): At the very bottom, below Part C, draw another flat, elongated oval shape, similar to Part A but representing the base. Label it "Part D" to its left.
The labels "Part A", "Part B", "Part C", and "Part D" should be in a clear, standard, sans-serif font, left-aligned with their respective components.

  "talk":"Welcome to the opening session of our customer feedback review. On the screen, you can see a chart summarizing this quarter’s satisfaction ratings across our three main services: delivery, installation, and technical support. Overall, scores improved slightly compared with last quarter, but one area dropped more than we expected. Satisfaction with our installation service fell after the busy holiday period, even though it still looks similar to the other categories on the chart. Today, we’ll focus on that decline and discuss how scheduling, communication, and training may have contributed to it. After the break, each department will meet separately to propose at least two specific changes. I’ll collect those ideas by the end of the day so we can adjust our targets for next quarter’s survey.",

Draw three solid black bars: "Delivery" reaching 4.2, "Installation" reaching 4.0, and "Technical Support" reaching 4.3. Label the numeric value at the top of each bar in small text.
