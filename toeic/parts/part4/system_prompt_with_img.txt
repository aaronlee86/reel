You are generating TOEIC Listening Part 4 sets of questions with visuals.

## Global Rules
- Exactly one speaker

- The talk must be 5 to 10 sentences (natural, coherent, no filler).
- The talk must be continuous narration — not a dialogue.
- If time is specified, always use 12-hour clock. For example, NEVER use 14:00, 19:30, etc.
- NEVER use commas in any numbers. e.g. $1300
- Do NOT copy the few-shot conversation content. Create new content each time.

## Visual Rules
- Provide context or data needed to answer at least one of the three questions related to the conversation
- Provide a LLM prompt to generate the visual.
- The prompt needs to be highly specific about the content, structure, and visual style

## Question Rules
- One set of talk has 3 questions.
- Each question has 4 choices, all similar in difficulty, no trick wording, No pattern bias.
- Must fit TOEIC part 4 style. For example:
  1. General Situation/Main Idea: Questions about the purpose of the talk, the speaker's identity, or the intended audience.
  2. Specific Details: Questions asking for a particular piece of information, often involving time, place, numbers, or action.
  3. Inference/Next Action: Questions that require you to understand implied meaning or what the listeners are advised to do next.
- At least one question has to use the visual to answer by starting the question with "Look at the graphic."
- Think step by step when designing options for visual questions.

## Answer Rules
- Answer must be exactly one of: "A","B","C","D", each letter is evenly likely (25%) to appear.
- Answer must match the content of the option, not the question.
- Only one correct option.

## Difficulty Level Rules:
- level 1:
  - Only one main idea.
  - Information is clearly and directly stated.
  - No inference required for questions.

- level 2:
  - Include 2–3 pieces of information (time, place, action).
  - Light paraphrasing required to find answers.
  - All answers are still directly supported by the script.

- level 3:
  - At least one inference-based question
  - At least one implied suggestion or consequence
  - Multi-step reasoning
  - Avoid any advanced academic vocabulary.

  "talk": "We’re happy to see you all at this seminar this afternoon — we have a lot of useful information to cover. But before we start, a few administrative details. There will be one break, half way through
the afternoon. You can leave your laptops here if you leave the room—there will always be someone in here—but do keep your money and phones or … ah … other small electronic
devices with you. Don’t leave them at the tables. And please note that there’s an error in your printed program: there will be a change—a switch—in times for the last two presenters. Ms. Ohta
has to leave a little early today.",
  "sex": null, // Pay attention to the content of the talk. Think step by step here. Becasue No gender is indicated in the talk, put null.
  "img_prompt": "Generate a formal, black-and-white program schedule with a distinctive decorative border, suitable for a classic event program or certificate.
Layout and Content:
Overall Frame: The entire content must be enclosed within a thick, ornamental double-line border. This border should have geometric, interlocking corner embellishments resembling interwoven patterns.
Main Title: Centered at the top, inside the border, display the word "Program". This title should be in a larger, bold, italicized serif font.
Column Headers: Below the main title, left-aligned with two distinct columns, display the headers "Presenter" and "Time". These should be in a medium-sized, italicized serif font.
Schedule Items (Aligned under headers):
On separate lines below the headers, list the following, maintaining the two-column alignment:
Ms. Carbajal | 1:00–1:50
Mr. Buteux | 1:55–2:45
BREAK | 2:45–3:00
Mr. Chambers | 3:00–3:50
Ms. Ohta | 3:55–4:45
All text for schedule items should be in a standard-sized, non-bold, italicized serif font.
Visual Style:
All text, lines, and decorative elements must be pure black.
The background inside and outside the border should be pure white.
The chosen font should be a classic serif typeface, and all text (including the main title and headers) must be italicized.
No shading, gradients, or other colors. The image should be flat and high-contrast.", // LLM prompt to generate the visual

  "talk": "Hi, Dori, this is Jack. I received your e-mail with the draft of the instructions for our outdoor table. The images that you’ve created look great—and this was such a rush job! I’m impressed you were able to finish it so soon. But—there was a change that I had to make. It was the number of parts. The base at the bottom of the single table leg is a separate piece, and it was missing from the picture. So I fixed it. Anyway, could you proof the change I’ve made as soon as you can? In the meantime, I’ll call the printer and let them know we’ll be sending the final draft. Thanks.",

  "img_prompt": "Generate a black-and-white, exploded-view technical diagram of a four-part assembly, resembling a simple pedestal or stand.
Components and Arrangement:
The diagram should show four distinct parts (A, B, C, D) stacked vertically with clear, even gaps between them, illustrating how they would fit together.
All parts should be drawn with thin black outlines on a pure white background, giving a clean, simple 2D line art style with just enough perspective to convey their volumetric shape.
Part A (Top): Draw a flat, elongated oval shape, representing a circular disc seen from an angle, at the very top. Label it "Part A" to its left.
Part B (Upper Middle): Below Part A, draw a shape like an inverted truncated cone or a shallow bowl, wider at the top edge and narrowing towards its bottom. Label it "Part B" to its left.
Part C (Lower Middle): Below Part B, draw an hourglass-like or biconcave cylindrical shape, which is wider at its top and bottom edges and significantly narrower in the middle. Label it "Part C" to its left.
Part D (Bottom Base): At the very bottom, below Part C, draw another flat, elongated oval shape, similar to Part A but representing the base. Label it "Part D" to its left.
The labels "Part A", "Part B", "Part C", and "Part D" should be in a clear, standard, sans-serif font, left-aligned with their respective components.
Visual Style:
No shading, textures, or complex details.
