You are solving a TOEIC Listening Part 4 question (1 visual + 1 question).

## Global Rules
- Comprehend the image prompt
- Understand the question
- Think logically for every option
- Give a score from 0 to 100 to each option by the following Rules
  1. The score is given according to the correctness of the option.
  2. give 0 if it is completely wrong
  3. give 100 it it is completely correct
  4. Do NOT make any assumption outside of the image prompt
  5. Do NOT refer to other options

## Few-Shot Example 1
Input:
{
  "img_prompt": "Generate a black-and-white, exploded-view technical diagram of a four-part assembly, resembling a simple pedestal or stand.
Components and Arrangement:
The diagram should show four distinct parts (A, B, C, D) stacked vertically with clear, even gaps between them, illustrating how they would fit together.
All parts should be drawn with thin black outlines on a pure white background, giving a clean, simple 2D line art style with just enough perspective to convey their volumetric shape.
Part A (Top): Draw a flat, elongated oval shape, representing a circular disc seen from an angle, at the very top. Label it "Part A" to its left.
Part B (Upper Middle): Below Part A, draw a shape like an inverted truncated cone or a shallow bowl, wider at the top edge and narrowing towards its bottom. Label it "Part B" to its left.
Part C (Lower Middle): Below Part B, draw an hourglass-like or biconcave cylindrical shape, which is wider at its top and bottom edges and significantly narrower in the middle. Label it "Part C" to its left.
Part D (Bottom Base): At the very bottom, below Part C, draw another flat, elongated oval shape, similar to Part A but representing the base. Label it "Part D" to its left.
The labels "Part A", "Part B", "Part C", and "Part D" should be in a clear, standard, sans-serif font, left-aligned with their respective components.
Visual Style: No shading, textures, or complex details. Pure black lines and text on a pure white background.",
  "question": "Look at the graphic. What part was originally missing from the picture?",
  "A": "Part A",
  "B": "Part B",
  "C": "Part C",
  "D": "No part is missing"
}

Output:
{
  "answer": {
    "A": 50,  // give 50 because the image doesn't give any clue of whether it's missing. So 50% chance this statement is correct
    "B": 50, // give 50 because the image doesn't give any clue of whether it's missing. So 50% chance this statement is correct
    "C": 50, // give 50 because the image doesn't give any clue of whether it's missing. So 50% chance this statement is correct
    "D": 50, // give 50 because the image doesn't give any clue of whether it's missing. So 50% chance this statement is correct
    "explain_A": "No information from the image", // 1 sentence explanation of A's score
    "explain_B": "No information from the image", // 1 sentence explanation of B's score
    "explain_C": "No information from the image", // 1 sentence explanation of C's score
    "explain_D": "No information from the image" // 1 sentence explanation of D's score
  }
}

## Few-Shot Example 2
Input:
{
  "img_prompt": "Design a simple terminal map showing three gates in a single concourse: Gates A5, B12, and C3. Layout and Content:
  - A horizontal concourse corridor with three gate markers spaced left to right: left marker labeled "A5", center labeled "B12", right labeled "C3".
  - Use a bold red circle or rounded rectangle highlight around "B12" to indicate the reassigned gate.
  - Place a small text box in the lower-left corner that reads: "Original: Gate A5" and another in the lower-right that reads: "New: Gate B12
  — Boarding 4:15 p.m.".
  Visual style: flat vector graphic, clear sans-serif labels, muted light-gray concourse background, gates and highlights in darker colors.
  Keep the image uncluttered and legible.",
  "question": "Look at the graphic. Which gate was the flight originally assigned to?"
  "A": "Gate A5",
  "B": "Gate B12",
  "C": "Gate C3",
  "D": "Gate D1"
}

Output:
{
  "answer": {
    "A": 100,  // give 100 because in the image prompt there is a small text box "Original: Gate A5", indicating A5 is the original gate.
    "B": 0, // give 0 because in the image prompt A5 is the orignal gate, not B12
    "C": 0, // give 0 because in the image prompt A5 is the orignal gate, not C3
    "D": 0, // give 0 because in the image prompt A5 is the orignal gate, not D1
    "explain_A": "In the prompt there is a small text box "Original: Gate A5", indicating A5 is the original gate.", // 1 sentence explanation of A's score
    "explain_B": "In the prompt A5 is the orignal gate, not B12", // 1 sentence explanation of B's score
    "explain_C": "In the prompt A5 is the orignal gate, not C3", // 1 sentence explanation of C's score
    "explain_D": "In the prompt A5 is the orignal gate, not D1" // 1 sentence explanation of D's score
