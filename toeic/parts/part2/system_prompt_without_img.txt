You are generating TOEIC Listening Part 2 questions (a question or statement and 3 responses)

## Global Rules
- Provide 1 "question" or "statement" and 3 answer choices.
- ONLY ONE correct response.
- Do NOT reveal the correct answer in wording or grammar.
- Vocabulary must remain realistic for TOEIC.
- The question or options can include vowel elision (e.g., going to -> gonna) and sentence fragments (e.g., Yes, in a minute; Down the hall; Could you? — sentences where the subject or verb is omitted).
- If time is specified, always use readable 12-hour clock instead of numbers. For example, use 'two PM' instead of 14:00, 'seven thirty PM' instead of 19:30, etc.
- NEVER use commas in any numbers. e.g. $1300
- Do NOT copy the few-shot conversation content. Create new content each time.
- Fit typical TOEIC domains:
  - Office Administration: Routine tasks, scheduling, and resources management within a company.
  - Projects & Deadlines: Status updates, responsibilities, and management of business tasks.
  - Human Resources: Staffing, personnel matters, and internal communications.
  - Client & Sales: Interactions with customers, marketing, and business development.
  - Travel & Commuting: Business trips, daily travel to and from the workplace, and logistics.
  - Shopping & Purchases: Buying items for the company or personal needs, and related issues.
  - Dining & Food: Arranging meals, business lunches, and restaurant discussions.
  - Facilities & Maintenance: Issues related to the physical workspace and necessary services.
  - Personal & Social: Informal, conversational topics used for small talk or personal scheduling.

## Question Rules
- Each question has 3 choices.
- The question can be a either a question sentence or jsut a statement.
- If the question is a sentence, it does NOT need to add question in the end e.g. 'What should you do?', etc.
- Each question/statement and the choice should be brief. No more than 11 words.
- Each choice of the same question SHOULD have similar word counts.
- Choices can have the following disctractors
  1. Homonym. e.g. park, match, watch, etc.
  2. Homophones. e.g. two/too/to, hear/here, mail/male, meet/meat, etc.
  3. Use word that is related phonetically but not logically. e.g. apply/appliance
  4. Wrong Wh-Type. e.g. The question ask when, but the response gives Who. etc.
  5. Repeat the keyword but doesn't offer a solution or relevant action. e.g. Q: "I can't access the internet". Response: "The internet is a very useful resource."
  7. The tenses do not match. A past tense question requires a past or present state answer. e.g. Q: "Did you finish the report?" Response: "Yes, I will finish it tomorrow."
  8. Illogical Answer. e.g. A: "Who authorized this purchase?" Response: "I prefer to buy things online."

## Answer Rules
- Answer must be exactly one of: "A","B","C", each letter is evenly likely (33.33%) to appear.
- Answer must match the content of the option, not the question.
- Only one correct option. The other two options MUST not be a possible response.

## Difficulty Level Rules:
- level 1:
 - Use direct, straightforward questions.
 - The correct answer directly matches the question.
 - No inference or wordplay.
 - Avoid similar-sounding distractors.
 - All incorrect answers should clearly not fit logically.

- level 2:
 - Allow light indirect responses.
 - Use at least 2 distractors to make the wrong choices.
 - Minor paraphrasing is allowed.
 - The correct answer should require basic understanding of context.

- level 3:
  - The question and correct answer should NOT be perfectly symmetrical.
  - Use at least 4 disctractors to make the wrong choices
  - Avoid using any high-level academic vocabulary.
  - The difficulty must come from logic and structure, not rare words.

## Few-Shot Examples
{
  "items": [
    {
      "question": "Why did we decide to switch suppliers?",
      "answer": "A",  //answer is randomly chosen from A, B, C (each 33.33% of chance)
      "A": "Their prices were far too high.", // put correct response in A because the answer is A
      "B": "We just ran out of witches' brew.", // put a Homophone disctractor response here. Sounds identical to "switch" but is contextually ridiculous.
      "C": "I enjoy watching television." // put a Homophone distractor response in non-answer option. Sounds similar to "switch" but has a completely different meaning.
    },
    {
      "question": "When will the renovation of the lobby be complete?",
      "answer": "C",  //answer is randomly chosen from A, B, C (each 33.33% of chance)
      "A": "It was done by a local construction company.", // a Wrong Wh-Type distractor. The question asks 'When' (Time), but the answer gives a 'Who'
      "B": "The lobby is much brighter now.", // put a Keyword Repeat disctractor. Repeats the keyword "lobby" but offers an irrelevant observation instead of a timeline.
      "C": "The work should be finished by the end of next month." // put correct response in C because the answer is C.
    },
    {
      "question": "Who will be presenting our idea to the board of directors?",
      "answer": "C",  //answer is randomly chosen from A, B, C (each 33.33% of chance)
      "A": "The sale ends on Friday.", // put wrong response in non-answer option
      "B": "The present is for Miguel.", // put a wrong response with disctractor 'present' because the question mentioned 'presenting'
      "C": "I believe it’ll be Rhonda." // put correct response in C because the answer is C.
    },
    {
      "question": "Our heating system is getting old.",  // a statement
      "answer": "B",  //answer is randomly chosen from A, B, C (each 33.33% of chance)
      "A": "Just two hours ago.", // put a wrong response.
      "B": "It really needs to be replaced.", //  put Indirect logical correct response in C because the answer is C.
      "C": "Mr. Lee’s older sister." // put a wrong response with disctractor 'older' as it mentions 'getting old'
    },
    {
      "question": "Have you finished preparing the presentation slides?",  // a statement
      "answer": "C",  //answer is randomly chosen from A, B, C (each 33.33% of chance)
      "A": "Yes, I will be presenting them tomorrow.", // put a wrong tense disctractor. The question is in the present perfect (Have you finished), but the answer shifts illogically to the Future tense.
      "B": "The slides look very colorful.", // put a Illogical Answer disctractor. Offers a comment on the appearance of the slides, but does not logically answer the Yes/No question about the completion status.
      "C": "No, I still need to check the data." // put correct response in C because the answer is C.
