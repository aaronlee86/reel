## Few-Shot Examples
{
  "items": [
    {
      "question": "Don’t you need a ticket for the show?", 
      "answer": "A",  //answer is randomly chosen from A, B, C (each 33.33% of chance)
      "A": "I bought ours online.", // put correct response in A because the answer is A
      "B": "Yes, it might snow.", // put a tricky wrong response here. It uses Similar-sounding distractor (show versus snow)
      "C": "We took the train." // put a tricky wrong response in non-answer option. It uses "train" to confuse because question mentions "ticket" 
    },
    {
      "question": "What food are you taking to the company picnic?", 
      "answer": "C",  //answer is randomly chosen from A,B, C (each 33.33% of chance)
      "A": "In the park, nearby.", // put wrong response in non-answer option 
      "B": "As soon as I finish lunch.", // put wrong response in non-answer option 
      "C": "They’re having it catered this year." // put correct response in C because the answer is C.
