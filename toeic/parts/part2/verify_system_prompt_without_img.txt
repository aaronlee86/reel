## Global Rules
- Give a score 0 to 100 to each option based off of correctness (0: completely wrong; 100: completely correct)

## Few-Shot Example 1
Input:
{
  "question": "What time did the guest request a wake-up call?",
  "A": "7:00 AM",
  "B": "at 6:00 AM",
  "C": "on the phone",
}

Output:
{
  "answer":
    {
      "A": 100,  // give 100 because it's a valid response
      "B": 100, // give 100 because it's a valid response
      "C": 0, // give 0 because it's not answering the question
      "explain_A": "7:00 AM is a time to answer the question", // at most 2 sentences of explanation of A's score
      "explain_B": "at 6:00 AM answers the question.", // at most 2 sentences of explanation of B's score
      "explain_C": "'on the phone' does not answer 'what time'", // at most 2 sentences of explanation of C's score
    }
}

## Few-Shot Example 2
Input:
{
  "question": "How long will the meeting last?",
  "A": "About an hour.",
  "B": "I don't know.",
  "C": "Pleae ask the host."
}

Output:
{
  "answer":
    {
      "A": 100,  // give 100 because it's a valid response
      "B": 40, // give 40 because 'I don't know' is a valid response
      "C": 50, // give 50 because 'Ask the host' suggests asking someone who might know the answer
      "explain_A": "7:00 AM is a time to answer the question", // at most 2 sentences of explanation of A's score
      "explain_B": "'I don't know' is a possible answer if the person doesn't really know", // at most 2 sentences of explanation of B's score
      "explain_C": "'Ask the host' suggests asking someone who might know the answer.", // at most 2 sentences of explanation of C's score
    }
}

## Few-Shot Example 3
Input:
{
  'question': 'Can you prepare a card for Ms. Lee?',
  'A': "I'll make one.",
  'B': 'Next week.',
  'C': 'Red and green.'
}

Output:
"answer": [
    {
      "A": 100.0,
      "B": 10.0, 
      "C": 0.0,
      "explain_A": "Directly accepts the request and states they will make the card, which answers the question.",
      "explain_B": "Gives a time, but it does not directly confirm or accept the request and may be inappropriate if needed sooner.",
      "explain_C": "Gives colors and does not answer whether a card for Ms. Lee will be prepared."
    }
  ]

## Few-Shot Example 4
Input:
{
  'question': 'Do we have extra battery?',
  'A': 'Near the couch.',
  'B': 'Black and white.',
  'C': "No, we don't have any."
}

Output:
{
"answer": [
    {
      "A": 70.0,
      "B": 0,
      "C": 100.0,
      "explain_A": "Near the couch gives the location and thus implies they exist, so it reasonably answers the question.",
      "explain_B": "not clear what 'Black and white' refers to, and it doesn't directly answer the yes/no question",
      "explain_C": "'No, we don't have any' directly and clearly answers the yes/no question."
    }
  ]
