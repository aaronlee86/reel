You are solving a TOEIC Listening Part 3 question (1 conversation + 3 follow-up question).

## Global Rules
- Comprehend the conversation
  1. Understand the role of the speakers
  2. Remember which line says by which speaker
  3. Pay attention to speaker's gender
- Understand the question
- Think logically for every option
- Give a score 0 to 100 to each option based off of correctness (0: completely wrong; 100: completely correct)

## Few-Shot Example 1
Input:
{
  "script": [
    {
      "speaker": "woman1",
      "line": "A guest called to request a wake-up call at six and asked about early check-in."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "man1",
      "line": "We can offer early check-in at noon, and I'm waiving the early fee for this reservation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "woman1",
      "line": "Should we hold their luggage if they arrive before the room is ready?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "man1",
      "line": "Yes, the front desk can hold luggage at no charge until the room becomes available."
    }
  ],
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What time did the guest request a wake-up call?",
      "A": "7:00 AM",
      "B": "6:00 AM",
      "C": "5:30 AM",
      "D": "8:00 AM",
    },
    {
      "question": "When can the guest check in early without an extra fee?",
      "A": "8:00 AM",
      "B": "Noon",
      "C": "12:00 PM",
      "D": "12:30 PM",
    },
    {
      "question": "Will the front desk charge to hold the guest's luggage?",
      "A": "Yes, a small fee",
      "B": "Yes, unless requested in advance",
      "C": "Yes, unless the guest is VIP",
      "D": "No, unless large luggage",
    }
  ]
}

Output:
{
  "answer": [ // give answer in order
    { // first element correspond to the first question
      "A": 0,  // give 0 because it's obviously wrong
      "B": 100, // give 100 because it's exactly right. 'woman1' says a guest called to request a wake-up call at six, which is the option B 6:00 AM
      "C": 0, // give 0 because it's obviously wrong
      "D": 0, // give 0 because it's obviously wrong,
      "explain_A": "the script says the guest requested a wake-up call at six, not seven.", // at most 2 sentences of explanation of A's score
      "explain_B": "woman1 says a guest called to request a wake-up call at six.", // at most 2 sentences of explanation of B's score
      "explain_C": "5:30 AM is not mentioned.", // at most 2 sentences of explanation of C's score
      "explain_D": "8:00 AM is not mentioned." // at most 2 sentences of explanation of D's score
    },
    { // second question
      "A": 0, // give 0 because it's obviously wrong
      "B": 100, // give 100 because it's exactly right. 'man1' says they can offer early check-in at noon
      "C": 100, // give 100 because it's exactly right. 'man1' says they can offer early check-in at noon which is also 12:00 PM
      "D": 90, // give 90 because it's highly possibly correct. Logically, if you can check-in at noon, you can check-in after noon. Therefore 12:30 PM is fine.
      "explain_A": "the staff offered early check-in at noon, not 8:00 AM.",
      "explain_B": "man1 explicitly says they can offer early check-in at noon.",
      "explain_C": "12:00 PM is the same time as noon, stated by man1.",
      "explain_D": "if check-in is allowed at noon, checking in at 12:30 PM would also be after that time; however the speaker specifically said noon, not 12:30."
    },
    { // third question
      "A": 0, // give 0 because it's obviously wrong
      "B": 0, // give 0 because it's obviously wrong
      "C": 0, // give 0 because it's obviously wrong
      "D": 5, // give 5 because they don't mention large luggage is the exception.
      "explain_A": "the man says the front desk can hold luggage at no charge, so there is no small fee.",
      "explain_B": "no condition about requesting in advance is mentioned; it is offered at no charge.",
      "explain_C": "no VIP exception is given; the policy is stated as no charge.",
      "explain_D": "man1 says luggage can be held at no charge until the room is available and does not mention an exception for large luggage, so this option is very unlikey." // at most 2 sentences of explanation of D's score
    }

Output:
{
  "answer": [ // give answer in order
    { // first question
      "A": 0, // give 0 because it's obviously wrong
      "B": 0, // give 0 because the question asks where the "woman" says the badges are, but in the conversation, it's the man "man1" says it.
      "C": 0, // give 0 because it's obviously wrong

    },
    { // second question
      "A": 10, // give 10 because she says in ten minutes, not 15 minutes
      "B": 80, // give 80 because in a few minutes is less precise, although it can mean 5 to 10 miinutes. It's a little vague
      "C": 100, // give 100 because it's correct
      "D": 0, // give 0 because it's obviously wrong
      "explain_A": "she says 'in ten minutes,' not 15 minutes—close but incorrect.", // at most 2 sentences of explanation of A's score
      "explain_B": "'a few minutes' is vaguer but could reasonably describe 'in ten minutes'; not as precise.", // at most 2 sentences of explanation of B's score
      "explain_C": "she explicitly says 'I'll swing by in ten minutes.'", // at most 2 sentences of explanation of C's score

    },
    { // third question
      "A": 50, // give 50 because "Sign a pickup form" is not enough. Also need to tell team name.
      "B": 50, // give 50 because "Tell reception your team name" is not enough. Also need to sign the form.
      "C": 0,
      "D": 100, // give 100 because it's exactly correct
      "explain_A": "signing a form at reception is part of the required actions, but the man also said to tell the team name, so this alone is incomplete.", // at most 2 sentences of explanation of A's score
      "explain_B": "telling reception the team name is also part of the instructions, but alone it's incomplete without signing the form.", // at most 2 sentences of explanation of B's score
