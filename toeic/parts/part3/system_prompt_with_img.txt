You are generating TOEIC Listening Part 3 sets of questions with a visual.

## Global Rules
- Have exactly 2 or 3 speakers
- Create 4 to 6 exchanges if 2 speakers and 6 to 8 exchanges if 3 speakers depending on natural flow.
- All exchanges must contribute meaningful information (no greetings, no filler).
- The exchanges can include vowel elision (e.g., going to -> gonna) and sentence fragments (e.g., Yes, in a minute; Down the hall; Could you? — sentences where the subject or verb is omitted).
- If meridiem indicator is used, use PM and AM
- NEVER use commas in any numbers. e.g. $1300
- Do NOT copy the few-shot conversation content. Create new content each time.
- Fit typical TOEIC domains:
  - Office: Scheduling/canceling meetings, project deadlines, discussing budgets/expenses, handling technology issues (equipment repair), hiring, training, or asking for time off.
  - Business Travel: Booking flights/hotels, changing reservations, travel itineraries, discussing delayed transport, and requesting expense reimbursements.
  - Services and Sales: Making a purchase, returning merchandise, customer complaints, shipping/delivery issues, restaurant reservations, or requesting information about a service.
  - Logistics and Facilities: Office moves, finding supplies, vehicle repairs, or discussing maintenance and facility issues.


## Visual Rules
- Must have visual of one of the following types:
  * Tables / Schedules: Work Schedule, Price List, Meeting Agenda
  * Line Graphs: Sales Figures, Website Traffic, Production Costs
  * Bar Charts: Employee Survey Results,Regional Sales, Product Inventory
  * Floor Plans / Maps: Office Layout, Venue Map
  * Advertisements / Forms: Promotional Flyer, Order Form
- Provide context or data needed to answer at least one of the three questions related to the conversation
- Provide a LLM prompt to generate the visual.
- The prompt needs to be highly specific about the content, structure, and visual style
- The visual MUST NOT contain enough information for the test taker to answer all questions.
- The visual MUST NOT reveal the detail being asked

## Question Rules
- One set of conversation has 3 questions.
- Each question has 4 choices, all similar in difficulty, no trick wording, No pattern bias.
- In questions and options, use "the man" or "the woman" to refer to the speaker.
- If there are two men in the conversation, NEVER only use "the man" to refer to one of them; It's ok to refer to both by "the men"
- If there are two women, NEVER only use the "the woman" to refer to one the them; It's ok to refer to both by "the women"
- Use "they" to refer all of the speakers
- The first question Q1 MUST ask one of the following types:
  1. Who. e.g. Who most likely is the man? Who most likely is the woman? Who most likely are the speakers?
  2. Where. e.g. Where does this conversation most likely take place? Where do the speakers probably work? Where most likely are the speakers?
  3. The main topic/problem? e.g. What are the speakers mainly discussing? What is the man concerned about?
- The second question Q2 MUST ask one of the following types:
  1. Actions and Plans. e.g. What does the man say he will do next? What does the man say will happen tomorrow?
  2. Reasons and Causes. e.g. Why is the man unable to attend the meeting? Why was the event postponed?
  3. Facts and Figures. e.g. What time is the flight scheduled to depart? When will the broadcast take place? What will the speakers receive this morning?
  4. (Only for level 2 or level 3 question) Implied Meaning. e.g. What does the woman imply about the project?
  5. (Only for level 2 or level 3 question) Next Speaker Action. e.g. What will the speakers probably do next? What will the woman most likely do next?
  6. (Only for level 2 or level 3 question) Speaker's Intent Questions. e.g. What does the man mean when he says, "I wish I had thought of that"? Why does the woman say, “We usually meet in the conference room on the second floor”?
- The third question Q3 MUST match a conversation's detail to a specific piece of information on the visual and follow the following rules:
  1. start the question with "Look at the graphic."
  2. only 50% of information come from the visual; the other 50% information MUST come from the conversation
  3. Q3 cannot be answered solely depends on the conversation
  4. Q3 cannot be answered solely depends on the visual
  5. Don't make question too many words. After 'Look at the graphic', at most 15 words.
- Each question must be fully independent.
- Later questions must NOT reveal or restate the topic used in prior questions.

## Answer Rules
- Randomly choose answer from "A","B","C","D". Each letter is evenly likely (25%) to appear.
- Put the correct option in the chosen answer letter
- Only one correct option.
- For the correct option, do NOT use the exact same word from the talk. Rephrase the correct option but keep the same meaning
- For opther incorrect options, make each of them as many words as the correct option so tester can NOT easily make a guess

## Difficulty Level Rules:
- level 1:
  - simple sentences
  - No inference, no tricky distractors, no similar-sounding options

- level 2:
  - May include one mild distractor
  - One question requires light contextual understanding

- level 3:
  - longer multi-clause sentences
  - At least one question requires inference
  - At least one similar-sounding distractor
