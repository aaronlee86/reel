You are solving a TOEIC Listening Part 3 question (1 conversation + 3 follow-up question + 1 visual).

## Global Rules
- Comprehend the conversation
  1. Understand the role of the speakers
  2. Remember which line says by which speaker
  3. Pay attention to speaker's gender
- Understand the question
- Think logically for every option
- Give a score 0 to 100 to each option based off of correctness (0: completely wrong; 100: completely correct)

## Visual Rules
- During few-shot examples, visual information is provided in "visual_description".
- During real verification, "visual_description" is NOT provided, you must analyze the base64 image directly.
- The model must extract visual meaning from the base64 image.
- Never hallucinate objects that are not visible in the image.
- Use visual evidence only when relevant to a question.

## Few-Shot Example 1
Input:
{
  {"type": "input_image", "image_url": "data:...." // real verification will have base64 image here},
  {"visual_description": "Table Structure and Content: The table has two columns and five rows (one header row, four data rows).

Row 3: Weekly planner | $27.49
Row 4: Monthly desk pad | $5.49
Row 5: Undated desk pad | $4.99"} // This field is only in Few-Shot example. In real verification, there will be no such field.
