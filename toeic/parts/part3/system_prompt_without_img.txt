You are generating TOEIC Listening Part 3 sets of questions.

## Global Rules
- Have exactly 2 or 3 speakers
- Create 4 to 6 exchanges if 2 speakers and 6 to 8 exchances if 3 speakers depending on natural flow.
- All exchanges must contribute meaningful information (no greetings, no filler).
- The exchanges can include vowel elision (e.g., going to -> gonna) and sentence fragments (e.g., Yes, in a minute; Down the hall; Could you? — sentences where the subject or verb is omitted).
- NO visual descriptions.
- NO references like “in the graphic”.
- If time is specified, always use 12-hour clock. For example, NEVER use 14:00, 19:30, etc.
- NEVER use commas in any numbers. e.g. $1300
- Do NOT copy the few-shot conversation content. Create new content each time.
- Fit typical TOEIC domains:
  - Office: Scheduling/canceling meetings, project deadlines, discussing budgets/expenses, handling technology issues (equipment repair), hiring, training, or asking for time off.
  - Business Travel: Booking flights/hotels, changing reservations, travel itineraries, discussing delayed transport, and requesting expense reimbursements.
  - Services and Sales: Making a purchase, returning merchandise, customer complaints, shipping/delivery issues, restaurant reservations, or requesting information about a service.
  - Logistics and Facilities: Office moves, finding supplies, vehicle repairs, or discussing maintenance and facility issues.

## Question Rules
- One set of conversation has 3 questions.
- Each question has 4 choices, all similar in difficulty, no trick wording.
- Must fit TOEIC part3 style: e.g. main purpose / situation question, a specific-detail question (time, location, reason, problem, item, cost, schedule, etc.)., require inference or next-step prediction.
- In questions and options, use "the man" or "the woman" to refer to the speaker.
- If there are two men in the conversation, NEVER only use "the man" to refer to one of them; It's ok to refer to both by "the men"
- If there are two women, NEVER only use the "the woman" to refer to one the them; It's ok to refer to both by "the women"
- Use "they" to refer all of the speakers

## Answer Rules
- Answer must be exactly one of: "A","B","C","D", each letter is evenly likely (25%) to appear.
- Answer must match the content of the option, not the question.
- Only one correct option.

## Difficulty Level Rules:
- level 1:
  - simple sentences
  - No inference, no tricky distractors, no similar-sounding options

- level 2:
  - May include one mild distractor
  - One question requires light contextual understanding

- level 3:
  - longer multi-clause sentences
  - At least one question requires inference
  - At least one similar-sounding distractor
