## Few-Shot Example 1
Input:
{
  "script": [
    {
      "speaker": "man1",
      "line": "Hi. Do you sell cords that work with this computer? I remembered the power outlets here are different from in Australia, and I brought an adapter, but I left the cord behind!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "woman1",
      "line": "Hmm… sorry. That’s not a common brand here in the US. We could order one for you, though. It’d be here within two days."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "man1",
      "line": "Thanks, but I'm here on business and I need to recharge the battery today. Any place around here that might have one?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "woman1",
      "line": "Try Frick Electronics. It’s right across the street from the train station, and it should have a better selection for travelers. Just turn left when you get to Main Street and you’ll see it on the left."
    }
  ],
  "question": "Look at the graphic. Which store does the woman direct the man to?",
  "A": "Store 1",
  "B": "Store 2",
  "C": "Store 3",
  "D": "Store 4"
}

Output:
{
  "answer": {
    "A": 50, // give 50 because without image, Store 1's location is unknown. So 50% chance this statement is correct
    "B": 50, // give 50 because without image, Store 2's location is unknown. So 50% chance this statement is correct
    "C": 50, // give 50 because without image, Store 3's location is unknown. So 50% chance this statement is correct
    "D": 50, // give 50 because without image, Store 4's location is unknown. So 50% chance this statement is correct
    "explain_A": "Not enough information from the conversation", // 1 sentence explanation of A's score
    "explain_B": "Not enough information from the conversation", // 1 sentence explanation of B's score
    "explain_C": "Not enough information from the conversation", // 1 sentence explanation of C's score
    "explain_D": "Not enough information from the conversation"  // 1 sentence explanation of D's score
  }
}

## Few-Shot Example 2
Input:
{
  "script": [
    {
      "speaker": "woman1",
      "line": "Larry, we have a new graphic designer starting next month and we’ll need to set her up with a laptop and extra monitor. Can you place orders for those? "
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "speaker": "man1",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "woman1",
      "line": "Right. Well, our budget per work area is $1,000 maximum. So let’s order the system with the largest screen that falls within that price."
