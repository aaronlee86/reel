## Few-Shot Example 1
Input:
{
  "img_prompt": "Generate a black-and-white, minimalist line-art map.
Map Layout:
The map should represent a crossroads intersection, dividing the image into four equal quadrants.
The horizontal street running through the center should be labeled "Main Street" in a clear, sans-serif font.
Quadrant Details:
Top-Left Quadrant:
Include a simple, outlined icon of a train or subway car (side profile) near the top-left corner.
Below the train, add a rectangular box with the text "Station" inside it.
To the right of the "Station" box, place a small, outlined square containing the number "1".
Top-Right Quadrant:
Place a small, outlined square containing the number "2" in the lower-left area of this quadrant.
Bottom-Left Quadrant:
Place a small, outlined square containing the number "3" in the upper-left area of this quadrant.
Near the bottom-right of this quadrant, place a small, solid black circle.
Immediately below the black circle, add the text "You are here" in a clear, sans-serif font.
Bottom-Right Quadrant:
Place a small, outlined square containing the number "4" in the upper-left area of this quadrant.
Overall Style:
All lines, text, and icons should be thin black outlines on a pure white background.
No shading, textures, or complex details.  The font used for all labels and numbers should be a simple, clean sans-serif.",
  "question": "Look at the graphic. Which store does the woman direct the man to?",
  "A": "Store 1",
  "B": "Store 2",
  "C": "Store 3",
  "D": "Store 4"
}

Output:
{
  "answer": {
    "A": 50, // give 50 because the image doesn't give any clue of what woman directs to. So 50% chance this statement is correct
    "B": 50, // give 50 because the image doesn't give any clue of what woman directs to. So 50% chance this statement is correct
    "C": 50, // give 50 because the image doesn't give any clue of what woman directs to. So 50% chance this statement is correct
    "D": 50, // give 50 because the image doesn't give any clue of what woman directs to. So 50% chance this statement is correct
    "explain_A": "No information from the image", // 1 sentence explanation of A's score
    "explain_B": "No information from the image", // 1 sentence explanation of B's score
    "explain_C": "No information from the image", // 1 sentence explanation of C's score
    "explain_D": "No information from the image"  // 1 sentence explanation of D's score
  }
}

## Few-Shot Example 2
Input:
{
  "img_prompt": "Design a simple terminal map showing three gates in a single concourse: Gates A5, B12, and C3. Layout and Content:
  - A horizontal concourse corridor with three gate markers spaced left to right: left marker labeled "A5", center labeled "B12", right labeled "C3".
  - Use a bold red circle or rounded rectangle highlight around "B12" to indicate the reassigned gate.
  - Place a small text box in the lower-left corner that reads: "Original: Gate A5" and another in the lower-right that reads: "New: Gate B12
  — Boarding 4:15 p.m.".
  Visual style: flat vector graphic, clear sans-serif labels, muted light-gray concourse background, gates and highlights in darker colors.
  Keep the image uncluttered and legible.",
  "question": "Look at the graphic. Which gate was the flight originally assigned to?"
  "A": "Gate A5",
  "B": "Gate B12",
  "C": "Gate C3",
  "D": "Gate D1"
}

Output:
{
  "answer": {
    "A": 100,  // give 100 because in the image prompt there is a small text box "Original: Gate A5", indicating A5 is the original gate.
    "B": 0, // give 0 because in the image prompt A5 is the orignal gate, not B12
    "C": 0, // give 0 because in the image prompt A5 is the orignal gate, not C3
    "D": 0, // give 0 because in the image prompt A5 is the orignal gate, not D1
    "explain_A": "In the prompt there is a small text box "Original: Gate A5", indicating A5 is the original gate.", // 1 sentence explanation of A's score
    "explain_B": "In the prompt A5 is the orignal gate, not B12", // 1 sentence explanation of B's score
    "explain_C": "In the prompt A5 is the orignal gate, not C3", // 1 sentence explanation of C's score
    "explain_D": "In the prompt A5 is the orignal gate, not D1" // 1 sentence explanation of D's score
