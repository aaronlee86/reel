## Global Rules

- No academic vocabulary or C1/C2 words.

- Avoid over-specific or unrealistic scenarios.
- Vocabulary must remain realistic for TOEIC.

## Photograph Rules
- Provide a LLM prompt to generate the photo.
- Photo can be of the following types
  - Pictures with People (Action/Activity Focus)
    1. One Person Action
    2. Multiple People Action
    3. Person's State/Posture
    4. People's Location/Preposition
    5. Clothing/Appearance
  - Pictures without People (State/Object Focus)
    6. Object Location/Arrangement
    7. Object State/Condition
    8. Passive Voice (Object Action)
    9. Scenery/Landscape
- The photo falls into two broad thematic categories:
  1. Business Professional:
      a. Office/Desk Work: People performing tasks common to an office setting.
      b. Meetings/Presentations: Interactions between two or more people, often focused on collaboration or instruction.
      c. Industrial/Manual Labor: Activities related to manufacturing, construction, or maintenance.
      d. Commercial/Retail: Scenarios involving stores, shops, or transactions.
  2. General and Public Life Themes:
      a. Outdoor/Public Spaces: Scenes set outside or in common areas.
      b. Travel/Transportation: Scenarios related to getting from one place to another.
      c. Food Service/Dining:	Pictures set in restaurants, cafés, or kitchens.
      d. Abstract Scenes/Landscapes:	Photos that focus on objects and environments without people (often testing passive voice and prepositions).

   and General/Public Life.

## Option Rules
- Only one correct option. The other 3 options MUST be incorrect distractors.
- Distractor types include:
    1. Incorrect Verb/Action: The statement describes an action that is not happening (e.g., The man is writing when he is clearly reading).
    2. Incorrect Preposition: The statement uses the wrong spatial relationship. (e.g. "The chair is on the desk." when it is next to the desk.)
    3. Similar Sounding Words: The statement uses a word that sounds similar to a visible noun or action, but means something completely different. (e.g. "The woman is knitting." when the woman is sitting. (Knitting/Sitting))
    4. Incorrect Passive Voice: The statement uses the passive voice to describe an action that is still happening when the picture only shows the result of a finished action. (e.g. "The flowers are being watered." when the picture shows the flowers have already been arranged in a vase.)

## Difficulty Level Rules:
- 1:
 - Describe only one clearly visible action or object.
 - Use simple present continuous or passive constructions.
 - No ambiguous wording.
 - No indirect or abstract descriptions.
 - The correct answer must be obvious based on the image.

- 2:
 - Describe two visible elements (action + location or object + position).
 - Allow light detail such as placement or background but keep clarity.
 - Avoid highly abstract expressions.
 - Distractors should be plausible but clearly incorrect.

- 3:
  - Use indirect or state-based descriptions.
  - Allow passive voice and slightly ambiguous phrasing.
  - The correct description should still match the image but require careful attention.
  - Distractors may describe similar actions but must not actually match the image.
  - Do NOT use advanced vocabulary.
